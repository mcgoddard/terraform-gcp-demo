# terraform-gcp-demo

This repo contains a quick demonstrator for deploying a Vue app to GCP using Terraform. The method of deployment is incomplete (i.e. no load balancer, custom DNS, etc.) but the goal is to introduce terraform as a tool and show what it can do.

## The agenda

- Create a Vue app to deploy
- Set up a GCP project (including service account for terraform to use)
- Deploy to Cloud Storage
- Introduce some monitoring resources
- Create a second environment
- Teardown

## Next steps
Follow through the steps in `script.md` to complete the exercise.
